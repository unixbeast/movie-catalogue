# movie-catalogue
An all inclusive web app for creating a catalogue of your movies using AngularJS, Node.js, and Deployd

This is a small project that came to life after my wife threatened to use Excel
to keep track of our movie collection.

It is a simple web app built using AngularJS (depends on bootstrap css) and Deployd (depends on Node.js).  Currently it is in
a proof of concept stage.  To get this fully working, it needs to be converted
to use a proper MongoDB database.

Tests need to be written, and styles need to be cleaned up.
